# Hello World! #

Let's take a look at our first Virgil program! As we'll see in later sections, here we simply define a _main_ method and make one call to a builtin function to print to the console.

```

def main() {
System.puts("Hello World!\n");
}```

If you've followed the instructions to [download](GettingStarted.md) and [run](BuildingAndRunningPrograms.md) programs, you should be able to simply run it:

<pre>
% virgil HelloWorld.v3<br>
Hello World!<br>
</pre>
